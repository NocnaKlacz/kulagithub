Version 1
Known bugs;
- Once every few hundred jumps, the Kula locks up, level restart or Kula respawn is needed
- In the event that a level has more than one key, if you pick up the first and then the second 
in less than a second, the game will not pass it, preventing you from completing the level. 
The solution is to place the keys further apart.
