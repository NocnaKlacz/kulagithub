Version 1
Known bugs;
- Once every few hundred jumps, the Kula locks up, level restart or Kula respawn is needed
- In case when a level has more than one key, if you pick up the first and then another one  
in less than a 1 second, the game will not count  it, preventing you from completing the level. 
The solution is to place the keys further apart.
