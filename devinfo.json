Version 1
Known bugs;
- Changing the keys responsible for movement and jump breaks the movement in the game.
- Once every few hundred jumps, the Kula locks up, level restart or Kula respawn is needed
- In case when a level has more than one key, if you pick up the first and then another one  
in less than a 1 second, the game will not count  it, preventing you from completing the level. 
The solution is to place the keys further apart.
- 'Cube 2' are not visible in the created thumbnail.
The solution is to raise Google item by Kula, for the duration of it, 'Cube 2' will also be visible in the created thumbnail.
